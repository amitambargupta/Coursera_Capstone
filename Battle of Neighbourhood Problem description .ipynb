    "* New York City's demographics show that it is a large and ethnically diverse metropolis. It is the largest city in the United States with a long history of international immigration. New York City was home to nearly 8.5 million people in 2018, accounting for over 40% of the population of New York State and a slightly lower percentage of the New York metropolitan area, home to approximately 23.6 million. Over the last decade, the city has been growing faster than the region. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States. This final project explores the best locations for Japanese restaurants throughout the city of New York. Potentially the owner of the new Japanese restaurant can have great success and consistent profit. However, as with any business, opening a new restaurant requires serious considerations and is more complicated than it seems from the first glance. In particular, the location of the restaurant is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will have success or a failure. So our project will attempt to answer the questions “Where should the investor open a Japanese Restaurant?” and “Where should I go If I want great Japanese food?”"

    "## Target Audience of this project and some demographic facts\n",
    "* This project is particularly useful to developers and investors looking to open or invest in a Japanese restaurant in the city of New York. Overall, New York is a great place to open a restaurant with an ethnical cuisine. As New York is the most diverse city in the world (800 languages are spoken in New York). With its diverse culture, comes diversity in the food items. There are many restaurants in New York City, each belonging to different categories like Chinese, Indian, French, etc. Why did we decide to focus on Japanese cuisine in our project? Now when the idea of a healthy lifestyle conquered the minds of people all over the country, Japanese restaurants became extremely popular, as they offer a healthy alternative to regular American eating habits."
